# ProgrammingAssignment4

This repo contains the script and supporting files for the 
final project for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

## Summary

The script and data set in this repo make use of the Human
Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI.
Please see the accompanying CodeBook.md for details on the 
data.

## Usage

1. Create a project directory and copy the run_analysis.R script in it.
1. Download and extract the UCI HAR dataset within this project directory. It should create a subdirectory named "UCI HAR Dataset".
1. Start R and be sure the working directory is set to the project directory.
1. Source run_analysis.R. It will create 2 files, both of which are descibed in detail in the code book:
..* mean-std.combined.csv
..* mean-std-summary-tidy.csv
